              <p style="color: blueviolet; font-size: large;"> Amazing Dance Band is Sierra Leone biggest and greatest band in the tweenty first century</h2>

                         The formation of this great Band started sometime in May, 2013, when the Nyallay family decided to commemorate their late mother’s 5th death anniversary in Kailahun. 
                         After planning the activities, issues on wake keeping came up. This necessitated the urge for the CEO to use the musical talent God endowed upon Him, 
                         couple with the vaulting desire to offer the best for his late, dearest mum.
                         An ad-hoc team was put together few days to the program.
                         It may surprise you to know that this makeshift band performed so well that everyone was like, why can't you build a band? Upon our return to Freetown, 
                         it was crystal clear that the time has come. <br><br>
                         We started working towards this insidiously with intense training and recruitment.
                         A couple of the founding members for obvious reasons fell along as we progressed. 
                         This band began to gain prominence in 2016 after we had mastered at least about 100 songs of different musical styles. By the end of 2016, 
                         we had acquired a complete set as required by Sierra Leonean standards, with grounded instrumentalists and vocalist that could compete with other bands.
                         We have emerged tall where ever we've performed, 
                         leaving a huge customer satisfaction, a burning desire to be recalled, to an extent that, they would prefer us second to none. <br><br>
                         Though we are yet to go into open band competitions for obvious reasons, many have rated us as one of the best bands in town due to our diversity
                         (our ability to copy and play different styles ranging from oldies to recent tracks).
                         To gain more prominence, the band is quietly working on an album that may lay the foundation for a local and international tour. 
                         In the interim, we want to assure you that this band is equipped with standard instruments and talented musicians that could stand the test of times.
                         You are assured of maximum entertainment and customer satisfaction if you ride with the Amazing band. <br><br>
                         A multi task band, this band can cover numerous programs ranging from; gospel to circular, wake–keepings to weddings, birthdays, parties etc. 
                         It should be your desire to ride with the Amazing band as we will lift your soul, shoot you off your seat to the dancing floor. 
                         You are assured of an Amazing entertainment with the Amazing band, the band that puts a smile on your face.

                         The band can now boast of thousands of fans and followers on facebook and other socaicl media group in and out of the country, 
                         and with the current leadership and membership,
                         the band is capable of doing split play whereby a team can play in Freetownand another in Bo or Makeni at the same time which shows how power and dynamic the band is.
